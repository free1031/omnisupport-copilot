# Week11 Evaluation System Blueprint

Week11 builds the quality control plane after Week10 controlled actions.

![Week11 code study route](../../assets/week11/week11-code-study-route.png)

Use this student-facing route map before reading the file map below. It orders
the Week11 code by the actual study path: RAG output shape, eval contracts,
typed models, metrics, runner orchestration, regression gate, calibration /
experiment helpers, and release governance binding.

```text
Week08 RAG response / Week10 action output
  -> evals/sets/rag_qa_golden_v2_3_0.jsonl
  -> evals/week11/runner.py
  -> evals/week11/metrics.py
  -> eval report JSON
  -> evals/week11/regression.py
  -> release manifest / CI gate / business SLO
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Deterministic first, LLM judge later

The classroom runner does not require RAGAS, DeepEval, or an online LLM judge.
It computes deterministic proxy metrics with the same report shape:

- `context_precision`
- `context_recall`
- `faithfulness`
- `answer_relevance`
- `answer_correctness`
- `semantic_similarity`

This keeps Docker/Podman classroom runs stable. Production can replace
`evals/week11/metrics.py` with real RAGAS / LLM-as-Judge while preserving
`contracts/evals/eval_report.schema.json`.

### 2. Dataset is a release asset

`evals/sets/rag_qa_golden_v2_3_0.jsonl` is not a loose test file. It carries:

- category: `happy / boundary / adversarial / multi_hop`
- expected answer
- expected keywords
- expected evidence IDs
- source document
- document version
- per-case thresholds

The release manifest binds the dataset by `id / version / digest`.

### 3. Red-team cases are stricter

Adversarial samples can pass by refusing, not by answering. `should_abstain`
and `forbidden_phrases` make the safety behavior explicit.

Regression gate uses:

```text
--no-drop adversarial_pass_rate
--no-drop safety_pass_rate
```

That means safety regressions block the release even if average quality looks
fine.

### 4. Judge prompt is versioned, not trusted blindly

`evals/judges/faithfulness.j2` and `evals/calibration/human_judge_gold_v1.jsonl`
show the production pattern:

1. Write judge prompt with scoring anchors.
2. Compare judge scores against human gold labels.
3. Record `cohen_kappa`, `pearson_r`, `mae`, and `top_k_overlap`.
4. Bind judge calibration summary into release manifest.

### 5. Business SLO is part of release quality

Week11 extends `contracts/release/release_manifest_schema.json` with:

- `eval_dataset`
- `judge_calibration`
- `business_slo`
- `rollout.auto_rollback_on`

This is the bridge to later governance weeks.

## Classroom Scope Boundary

Student Core Pack includes:

- JSONL golden set and schema.
- Deterministic local evaluation runner.
- Regression gate CLI.
- Judge prompt and calibration math.
- A/B helper.
- Business SLO checker.
- CI gate example.

Not included in Week11 Student Core:

- Mandatory online RAGAS execution.
- Mandatory paid LLM judge.
- Hosted evaluation dashboard.
- Full canary rollout controller.

Those are production expansions after students understand the control loop.
